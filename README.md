# üç¶ Vanilla To-do

Just what the world needed - yet another "To-do app".

This "app" is made in Vanilla JavaScript, meaning no frontend framework/library was used.

Vanilla To-do supports:

- ‚úÖ Moving task position
- ‚úÖ Saving tasks in local storage
- ‚úÖ Deleting all completed tasks
- ‚úÖ Dark mode
- ‚úÖ Sick animations (Shout out, [AutoAnimate](https://github.com/formkit/auto-animate))
- ‚úÖ Selecting emojis in multiple skin colors (Shout out, [emoji-picker-element ](https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element))
- ‚úÖ Inspirational quotes to get the juices flowing (Shout out, [Quotable.io API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable))

## Dependencies

It has two dependencies:

- [AutoAnimate](https://github.com/formkit/auto-animate) - used to add that sweet animation.
- [emoji-picker-element](https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element) - used for the task emoji picker.

The "app" also uses the [Quotable.io API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to fetch a random, inspirational quote. If it fails to fetch, it will set a default quote.
